# ansible

This is a repository containing some Ansible-related items that I used to provision my Linux servers as virtualization hosts. I plan to better organize components of this repository. Part of this includes splitting this code into dedicated Ansible collection repositories. (If you want to take this on, feel free! LMK and I can help you get started.)
